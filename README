# My PhD manuscript

This is my PhD manuscript which can be viewed [here](https://etienne-monier.github.io/publications/monier2020thesis.pdf).

I post the codes online for insparation about the template or the TikZ figures handling system.

## Generate the manuscript

The manuscript can be generated very easily by simply typing

```
$ git clone https://github.com/etienne-monier/2020-Thesis.git Manuscript
$ cd Manuscript
$ latexmk
```

## Some words about the template

The template is based on the [`tufte-book`](https://ctan.org/pkg/tufte-latex) document class. This style is sometimes painful, especially for figures which is redefined in the class style file. Some examples:

1. The `label` command becomes weak in `tufte-book` class. It means that you cannot make a nice 

```
\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics{...}
    \caption{...}
    \label{...}
\end{figure}
```

but you have to specify the label in the `caption` command with a `protect` before.

```
\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics{...}
    \caption{\protect\label{...}...}
\end{figure}
```

Same thing for `ref` in the caption.

```
\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics{...}
    \caption{\protect\label{...} ... \protect\subref{...} ... }
\end{figure}
```


2. Specifying `[b]` to place figures in the bottom of a page generally places it at the end of the chapter.

3. I used 4 kind of figure display : with side / below caption with textwidth / pagewidth width.  

4. The only compatible package for subfigures is the obsolete [`subfigure` package](https://ctan.org/pkg/subfigure).

The main reasons I whatever used it:

* That's simply beatiful !
* The right margins are perfect to write notes in the paper version.

## Some words about the figure system

I simply love making TikZ figures ! I find it sublime :)

The main problem when using it only:
* a memory error rapidly appears when making lots of pgfplots figures,
* the compilation time becomes excessive
* generally, you can attempt to resize your figure, which makes the font size smaller than the main content font size.

To solve this, I externalized everything with separated `.tikz` files to execute separately (thanks to the `standalone` document class). I finally made a small recipe in the `.latexmkrc` file to automatically generate the pdf graphics based on the tikz file.

Beware ! To that end, each separate execution needs to reach the style files located in the `/style` folder. For simplicity, I just linked them in the texmf folder:

```
$ cd ~/.texmf/tex/latex/
$ ln -s /path/to/Manuscript/style/ 
```
